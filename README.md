Very simple package that provides a `Reverse` extension method to strings in C#.

**Version 1.0.1** - This version fixes the previous version's dependency on NUnit.

**Usage:**
```cs
using ReversedString;

...

var reversed = "123456".Reverse();
// reversed == "654321"
```

**Nuget**
This is available as a [nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/ReversedString).
